 Web accessibility:The Web should be designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. When the Web meets this requirement, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of abilities like hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive abilities.


 WHY IS WEB ACCESSIBILITY IMPORTANT:
 If everyone can access and use your clients’ web pages that means:

More traffic: a larger audience can access the websites. 
More sales and conversions: Since the site gets more traffic, it gets more conversions too.
Better search engine optimization (SEO): More traffic, a better bounce rate, all sends positive feedback to search engines.
Better user experience: Accessible content and accessible design is user-friendly, so it’s easier to navigate and understand for everyone.


An accessible website can be used by people with all types of disabilities:

Those with visual impairments or color blindness
Those with auditory disabilities
Those who must navigate by voice
Those with cognitive disabilities,
Those with temporary disabilities
Those who need to use screen readers or other assistive technologies.
